allowing personal data to be used with the help of a personal data sharing intermediary that safeguards data subjects’ rights under the GDPR;,data protection law
With its definition of personal data the GDPR has determined an ample scope: “personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name an identification number location data on online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical physiological genetic mental economic cultural or social identity of that natural person.”,data protection law
Anonymization of personal data can enable a data controller to further process the data without considering the data protection requirements provided that the data is no longer related to an identified or identifiable person.64,data protection law
Please note that pseudonymization of personal data (replacing identifiable personal data by a pseudonym) is reversible and can therefore only be used as an additional security safeguard for the processing.,data protection law
In addition the rise of Big Data and AI has clearly shown that what might appear at a given point in time as anonymous data or other data with no connection or relevance to natural persons may actually turn out to be an element of personal data once it is combined with other identifiers.66,data protection law
Any concept regarding data spaces such as IDS must therefore be prepared to cater for compliance requirements regarding both personal and non-personal data.,data protection law
separately—which may result in different legal basis applying depending on the nature of processing the various data consumers envision.,data protection law
The EU Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data74 has two core objectives: ensuring the free movement of non-personal data across Member State borders i.e. removing data localization requirements between Member States (and preserving availability and access to data for regulatory control purposes)75,data protection law
Accordingly data licensing agreements do not yet follow general common standards that practitioners can “pull off the shelf” such as in the world of software licensing. In any event therefore it is helpful to be aware of the fundamentally different types of contractual,data protection law
Obviously any participant in an IDS-based data exchange must be aware and ensure to take the appropriate measures to act in compliance with applicable laws in particular with mandatory rules of data protection law (GDPR),data protection law
The GDPR applies at any time where data providers share personal data i.e. “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name an identification number,data protection law
location data an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical physiological genetic mental economic cultural or social identity of that natural person” 91 triggering all the relevant provisions regarding a legal basis92 and its limitations on purpose variation93 and transparency through privacy notices94 ensuring data subjects rights95 documentation requirements96 and breach notifications.97,data protection law
Where personal data breaches occur the data controller(s) will need to assess the risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects and if so notify within 72 h the competent data protection authority and in case of significant risks also the data subjects.103,data protection law
GDPR—respectively assess in the first place if and to which extent it is willing and capable to process personal data in light of those requirements or determine that its data contributions and data exchange shall exclude personal data from the outset.,data protection law
This kind of traceability is similar to the data protection requirements a data controller is confronted with so as to be able to fulfill its data subjects’ right to access. It is also closely related to the question of proving compliance with contracts agreements or legal regulations. And data provenance tracking can be used to facilitate clearing in decentralized data ecosystems since it is capable of aggregating information concerning data exchange transactions and data usage.,data protection law
It thereby supports the requirements to be met by the actors within the ecosystem to achieve secure and reliable interoperability as well as desirable behavior regarding the use of data.,data protection law
The Business Layer (see Chapter 3.1) facilitates the development and use of new digital business models to be applied by the Participants in the International Data Spaces. It also specifies the roles within the IDS. Thereby it is directly related to the Governance Perspective by considering the business point of view regarding data ownership data provision and data consumption and by describing core service concepts such as data brokerage.,data protection law
GDPR compliance in the relation between the platform operator and the data provider/data consumer and between the data,data protection law
such as data extraction for private purposes teaching and scientific research as well as extraction and/or re-utilization for public security or administrative or court procedures.,asset
It is rather the data provider who intentionally enables the data consumer (or a variety of them) and other participants in the ecosystem to derive and/or generate each individually new and different information and value from using the data.,asset
In contrast to the general communication capabilities described above the Message concept describes the content payload being exchanged at runtime between Connectors. Message metadata provides traceable evidence of the communication,asset
communication (e.g. addresses transaction ID) and allows interpretation of the context (i.e. type of content usage contract) within which an Instance of a Resource’s digital content is mediated.,asset
Thus the Message metadata may either complement interactions of legacy application protocols or may be used independently as a foundation for modeling the exchange of the Resource in a generic technology-agnostic manner. In the latter case each state of the interaction is mapped onto an instance of an appropriate Message type,asset
Action attributes describing the intended action (e.g. read write or delete);,asset
Alongside with operations on Assets (e.g. copy print convert) an Action may comprise general obligations (e.g. pay attribute) or modify the interpretation of the policy (e.g. ensure exclusiveness)36.,asset
“Publishing” defines which Data Flows or Data Services are provided to external participants. This information is submitted to a Broker.,asset
For “Accounting” of a data exchange transaction between participants it is necessary to record additional information such as contract specifications pricing models or billing details.,asset
The action describes what the subject wants to do with the data asset (e.g. read write).,asset
The environment specifies the context of the action (e.g. time location).,asset
The International Data Spaces offers a platform for organizations to offer and exchange data and digital services.,asset
The Commodity concern helps assess the value and utility of a Resource as an obtainable asset with regard to a client’s needs.,asset
Does the Resource origin from a reliable source?,asset
What level of quality does the Resource have?,asset
Provenance explicates the context of the Resource’s creation and its history of modification. The Quality of a Resource’s content and provisioning services may be assessed by means of tests quality of service (QoS) parameters and ratings from previous users in the community.,asset
Resource (or object) attributes describing the resource itself (e.g. object type location or classification);,asset
It is indisputable that data has a value and that data management generates costs. Today data is traded in the market like a commodity; it has a price and many companies monitor the costs incurred for data management. However data being an intangible good differs from tangible goods with regard to a number of properties among which the fact that data is non-rival is considered the most important one.,asset
Depending on what type data is of or what category it can be subsumed under the value it contributes to the development of innovative products and services can vary. Therefore the need for protection of data is not the same across all data types and data categories. Public data for example which can be accessed by anyone requires a lower level of protection than private data or club data.,asset
ASSET An Asset is the subject of a Rule a Resource or a collection of Resources. Depending on the Policy’s specifications (e.g. do not redistribute) the Asset’s content needs to be identified in a persistent and unambiguous manner in order to be effectively enforceable independently of the provisioning type (e.g. download URL) or storage context (Data Provider or Data Consumer) (for example by an identifier composed of indicators such as artifact name and hash sum).,asset
Pricing models applied to Resources exchanged in the International Data Spaces may vary.,asset
Connectors may expose an arbitrary number of Resources that provide or consume digital content. The Catalog comprises a metadata model of those Resources constructed in accordance with the IDS Ontology. Optionally the Catalog or individual sets of Resource metadata may be advertised via intermediary nodes,asset
The Content concern deals with the description of a Resource’s inherent substance i.e. its “content” available in any machine-interpretable binary format.,asset
The Commodity concern helps to assess the value and utility of a Resource.,asset
“Metadata” describes the data types for input and output used by different Connector components (see chapter 3.4.5 - App Interfaces). Data Services can provide metadata descriptions which can be imported to the Configuration Model. This information is used to configure the Data Flow.,asset
As data can be decoupled from specific hardware and software implementations it turns into an independent economic good. While this opens up new opportunities it creates challenges as well. To ensure competitiveness of organizations a solution is required that facilitates new digital business models.,asset
The resource describes the data asset.,asset
In general attributes can describe anything or anyone. Nevertheless they can be divided into four major categories:,asset
Subject attributes describing the user by e.g. their age role or clearance;,asset
Context (or environment) attributes addressing time location or other dynamic aspects.,asset
Because of the correlation between good data quality and maximizing the value of data as an economic good the International Data Spaces explicitly addresses the aspect of data quality.,asset
As perishable goods were exposed to improper ambient temperatures the company ordering the goods refuses acceptance. The temperature data thereby becomes a shared data asset that can be stored in a shared environment which acts as a trusted record keeper of such quality data.,asset
Several companies want to share their capabilities in order to produce a certain type of good. In this case the capability of each company becomes a shared data asset to be stored in shared ‘yellow pages’ accessible for all participants in the ecosystem.,asset
but not the data as such.8,asset
giving any contributor of data the opportunity to manage and maintain control over the data that it puts at the disposal of others.,data sovereignty
select and limit the type of metadata that he/she shares with the service provider and certain intermediaries.,data sovereignty
When going further in sharing data with a business innovator working on an AI-based optimization of the manufacturing process he/she may want to limit the data he/she shares to other parts of the metadata in respect of the same manufacturing process.,data sovereignty
Data sovereignty is about finding a balance between the need for protecting one’s data and the need for sharing one’s data with others. It can be considered a key capability for companies to develop in order to be successful in the data economy.,data sovereignty
Data sovereignty which is one of the main goals of the International Data Spaces materializes in “terms and conditions” that are linked to data before it is exchanged and shared.,data sovereignty
However these terms and conditions (such as time to live forwarding rights pricing information etc.) have not been standardized yet. In order to foster the establishment of data sovereignty in the exchange of data within business ecosystems more standardization activities are needed.,data sovereignty
Define usage constraints for data resources,data sovereignty
Transfer data with usage constraints linked to data,data sovereignty
Authorize Data Provider if Data Provider is not the Data Owner,data sovereignty
As the need for Data Sovereignty is obvious but the term of ownership is not defined for data the term “Data Sovereign” indicates the rights duties and responsibilities for this role.,data sovereignty
Data sovereignty is a natural person’s or corporate entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data.,data sovereignty
a data owner in the International Data Spaces attaches usage restriction information to their data before it is transferred to a data consumer. To use the data the data consumer must fully accept the data owner’s usage policy.,data sovereignty
To find that balance it is important to take a close look at the data itself as not all data requires the same level of protection and as the value contribution of data varies depending on what class or category it can be subsumed under.,data sovereignty
In fact the path toward parameterizing different types of contracts and ascertaining related contractual remedies under a governing law (to be selected) bears a multitude of complexities which need to be further explored.,governing law
Under current law the most notable (yet largely unknown and underestimated) legal instrument available and applied to collections of data is the right of the database maker as provided under the EU Database Directive 96/9/EC and implemented in each EU Member State.6,governing law
The database right protects the investment into the systematical and methodical order of a collection of data in order to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of the database7,governing law
In addition to the tools of usage control and confidentiality agreements however it is important to consider the scope and inherent limitations under the EU Trade Secrets Directive (EU) 2016/943 and its varying implementation into national law of the EU Member States.,governing law
Together with this ambitious claim the EU Commission has presented its EU Data Strategy as a cornerstone to a wider framework of existing and upcoming regulation.26,governing law
The EU Commission has set important milestones for transforming the single market into a digitally enabled market and making the EU “leading in a data-driven society” and empowering “people businesses and organisations ... to make better decisions based on insights from non-personal data which should be available to all” 24 and creating a “data-agile economy.”,governing law
The EU Data Strategy envisions three fundamental objectives namely (1) the free flow of data within the EU and across sectors; (2) full respect of European rules and values including in particular personal data protection consumer protection and competition law; and (3) fair practical and clear rules for fair access and use of data based on trustworthy data governance mechanisms.27,governing law
importance of data spaces as part of the first pillar (1) aiming to “enable a legislative framework of the governance of common European data spaces” 29 as well as providing significant investment and funding in High Impact Projects on European data spaces and federated cloud infrastructures.30,governing law
As part of its data space strategy the EU Commission has identified the following sectors where it intends to create “Common European data spaces”: industrial/ manufacturing Green Deal mobility health financial energy agriculture public administration and skills.33 In other words IDS represents a role model if not a blueprint for these sectors to prepare and develop—in an active dialogue with the relevant stakeholders—the related data space implementations in accordance with the EU Data Strategy.,governing law
The Data Governance Act of May 30 202234 is a pillar in the EU Data Strategy and will be complemented by the European Data Act to foster data sharing among businesses and between business and governments35 and stands next to the Digital Markets Act36 and the Digital Services Act.37 It contains key elements of regulation for operators of data spaces.,governing law
The Data Governance Act accentuates the role and provides notification obligations for providers of data sharing services (“data intermediaries”) in an approach to create a European model for data sharing of personal and non-personal data through “neutral data intermediaries” as an alternative to the current prevalence and market,governing law
From an institutional perspective the Data Governance Act will create a “European Data Innovation Board” consisting of representatives of the Member States the EU Commission and representatives of relevant data spaces and specific sectors (e.g. health agriculture transport and statistics).47,governing law
As for data held by the public sector the Data Governance Act establishes a few key principles: generally public sector bodies shall not enter into exclusive agreements for the re-use of data they hold nor may they restrict the availability of the data for re-use unless (as an exception to the rule) where a data consumer receives exclusive rights for a maximum of 3 years in order to provide a service or product in the general interest and under a national concession issued in accordance with general transparency principles.49,governing law
The Data Governance Act requires data intermediaries to follow a notification procedure in regard to the following types of intermediation services: (1) between data holders (as legal persons) and data consumers both in bilateral or multilateral data exchanges or the creation of platforms or databases that enable the exchange or joint exploitation of data as well as the establishment of a specific infrastructure for the interconnection of data holders and data consumers;,governing law
between data subjects that want to make their personal data available and potential data consumers thereby facilitating the data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR; and,governing law
services of data cooperatives particularly in the areas of micro small and mid-size enterprises.52 The concept of notification does not imply an approval by the authorities53 but rather provides a mechanism to determine certain conditions for data intermediary services (before commencing their activity)54 and to establish a supervisory control over an intermediary’s compliance with such conditions55 which can impose “dissuasive financial penalties” (to be further defined by the Member States) if need be.56,governing law
While the following explanations stand against the background of German law (and hence need to bear in mind that underlying statutory law can impact the formation and interpretation of contracts) they are to a considerable degree generic in nature and can be applied to other jurisdictions (even if adaptations under local law remain indispensable).,governing law
choice of governing law and dispute resolution.,governing law
From a German legal perspective (which can at least be helpful also for other civil law jurisdictions) the categorization of contract types can help in this regard (Fig. 5.2).,governing law
It supports collaborative governance mechanisms so that the common service and value propositions are achieved while protecting the interests of all actors.,governing law
As innovative business models and digital data-driven services require enhanced data management capabilities the role of data governance is increasingly receiving attention.,governing law
To manage data under consideration of business needs and the existing digital infrastructure data governance being a leadership function of data management acts as an enabler for successfully engaging in a collaborative ecosystem.,governing law
Therefore the management of data related resources by means of decision rights accountabilities roles and ownership makes data governance a fundamental element in the International Data Spaces ecosystem.,governing law
They ensure that relevant guidelines and principles regarding data assets are in place and monitored. However traditional instruments for assigning decision rights and accountabilities in terms of data usually do not reach beyond an organization’s borders. Thus the influence of authority for the individual actor within a data ecosystem might be limited. The IDS-RAM addresses this challenge in a federated manner by distributing decision rights for data governance and management activities to the different roles in the International Data Spaces ecosystem.,governing law
As the International Data Spaces intends to build upon and apply existing law it will not include any purely technology-oriented solutions to prevent data duplication or misuse of data assets.,governing law
The International Data Spaces thereby supports the concrete implementation of applicable law without predefining conditions from a business point of view by providing a technical framework that can be customized to the needs of individual participants.,governing law
Data Owners define attribute-based access control policies for their endpoints. In addition they define the attribute values a subject must attest in order to grant access to the resource.,IDS core participants
A Participant is a legal or natural person assuming a role (or more than one role) in the International Data Spaces. Participants must undergo a formal certification process.,IDS core participants
Core components to be used in the IDS must provide the required functionality and level of security. The certification of core components focuses on interoperability and security while aiming to strengthen the development and maintenance process of these components.,IDS core participants
To build this trust in a structured way the International Data Spaces has established a well-defined process for core component certification. An in-depth description of the certification process and how it applies to the key elements of the IDS architecture can be found in Part 3 of the White Paper Certification. The core component certification criteria catalogue is available for free to all IDSA members.,IDS core participants
Actors in the market can make use of the International Data Spaces standard for providing software services and technology to the market.,IDS core participants
The Business Layer of the Reference Architecture Model defines and categorizes the different roles the participants in the International Data Spaces may assume. Furthermore it specifies basic patterns of interaction taking place between these roles. It thereby contributes to the development of innovative business models and digital data-driven services to be used by the participants in the International Data Spaces.,IDS core participants
Core Participants are involved and required every time data is exchanged in the International Data Spaces. Roles assigned to this category are Data Owner Data Provider Data Consumer Data User and App Provider. The role of a Core Participant can be assumed by any organization that owns wants to provide and/or wants to consume or use data.,IDS core participants
Benefit for participants in the International Data Spaces is created by these roles as they make data available (Data Owner) provide data (Data Provider) or consume/use data (Data Consumer Data User App Provider). In addition Data Providers and Data Consumers may apply business models (including pricing models) as deemed appropriate.,IDS core participants
As the legal situation regarding data ownership is very complicated (as discussed in section 4.3.4) the term ‘Data Owner’ is not used in a legal understanding in this document.,IDS core participants
The Reference Architecture Model takes an operational data management perspective defining a Data Owner as a legal entity or natural person creating data and/or executing control over it. This enables the Data Owner to define Data Usage Policies and provide access to its data.,IDS core participants
TThe Data Provider makes data available for being exchanged between a Data Owner and a Data Consumer. As already mentioned above the Data Provider is in most cases identical with the Data Owner but not necessarily. To submit metadata to a Broker or exchange data with a Data Consumer the Data Provider uses software components that are compliant with the Reference Architecture Model of the International Data Spaces.,IDS core participants
Providing a Data Consumer with data from a Data Owner is the main activity of the Data Provider. To facilitate a data request from a Data Consumer the Data Provider should provide a Broker Service Provider (see below) with proper metadata about the data. However a Broker Service Provider is not necessarily required for a Data Consumer and a Data Provider to establish a connection.,IDS core participants
The Data Consumer receives data from a Data Provider. From a business process modeling perspective the Data Consumer is the mirror entity of the Data Provider; the activities performed by the Data Consumer are therefore similar to the activities performed by the Data Provider.,IDS core participants
Like a Data Provider the Data Consumer may log the details of a successful (or unsuccessful) data exchange transaction at a Clearing House use Data Apps to enrich transform etc. the data received or use a Service Provider to connect to the International Data Spaces (if it does not deploy the technical infrastructure for participation itself).,IDS core participants
Similar to the Data Owner being the legal entity that has the legal control over its data the Data User is the legal entity that has the legal right to use the data of a Data Owner as specified by the usage policy. In most cases the Data User is identical with the Data Consumer. However there may be scenarios in,IDS core participants
which these roles are assumed by different participants. For example a patient could use a web-based software system to manage their personal health data and grant access to this data to a health coach. The data could be received from a hospital. In this case the health coach would be the Data User and the provider of the web-based software system would be the Data Consumer.,IDS core participants
App Providers develop Data Apps to be used in the International Data Spaces. To be deployable a Data App has to be compliant with the system architecture of the International Data Spaces (see Section 3.5). In addition Data Apps can be certified by a Certification Body in order to increase trust in these applications (especially with regard to Data Apps processing sensitive information). Each Data App must be published in the App Store for being accessed and used by Data Consumers and Data Providers. App Providers should describe each Data App using metadata (in compliance with a metadata model) with regard to its semantics functionality interfaces etc.).,IDS core participants
Enforcement of data usage rules on the connector (external criteria): position time legal requirements,policy negotiation
To enforce data usage restrictions a system’s actions need to be monitored and potentially intercepted by control points (i.e. Policy Enforcement Points PEPs). These actions must be judged by a decision engine (i.e. a Policy Decision Point PDP) for requesting permission or denial. In addition to just allowing or denying an action the decision engine may also require modification of the action. A PEP component encapsulates the enforcement.,policy negotiation
Data usage control can be implemented by means of a machine-readable contract which is expected to be fulfilled by a party. It is a way to track and trace data as it is used within different systems and to collect evidence of the violation of agreed usage constraints. With that in mind solutions range from organizational rules or legal contracts to completely technical ways of enforcing usage restrictions. For example an organizational rule (e.g. a company policy) could state that employees must not use removable storage devices such as USB sticks.,policy negotiation
Similarly a technical form of enforcement such as group policies specified by the Windows operating system can prevent employees from using removable storage devices. In some scenarios organizational rules legal contracts and technical rules can be used interchangeably. In other scenarios the three forms can be used to complement each other. In the long run it can be expected that organizational rules and legal contracts will increasingly be replaced by technical forms of enforcement,policy negotiation
The policy decision may also depend on additional information that is not present in the intercepted system action itself. This includes information about the context such as data flows or the geographical location of an entity. It is also possible to specify pre- or post-conditions that have to hold before (e.g. integrity check of the environment) and after (e.g. data item is deleted after usage) decision-making. In addition it is possible to define on-conditions that have to hold during usage (e.g. only during business hours). These conditions usually specify constraints and permissions that have to be fulfilled before during and after using data,policy negotiation
Another important aspect of data usage control is the specification and management of usage restrictions. Data Providers have to express data usage restrictions in a more or less formal way. For technical enforcement the specification must produce a machine-readable output.,policy negotiation
Usage restriction policy information can be attached to the data that is about to be exchanged. This type of policy is called sticky policy45. Following this approach data is encrypted before it is sent to a Data Consumer and it can only be decrypted if the Data Consumer fully and explicitly accepts the usage restrictions specified.,policy negotiation
A usage restriction policy can be stored independently of the data it relates to (for instance in a central component such as a PMP/PRP). In this case the management component has the responsibility to exchange usage restriction information between different systems.,policy negotiation
For example the ODRL Constraint class expresses logical conditions that govern the applicability of a Rule.,policy negotiation
In addition Connectors as Data Providers should provide the technology-dependent policies to the data they provide – for all kinds of systems and enforcement technologies that are part of the ecosystem.,policy negotiation

Where the data provider relies on consent he/she will need to provide appropriate consent management tools (including the option to withdraw consent); where he/she relies on legitimate interest he/she will need to safeguard the right of objection.71,policy negotiation

It includes that the rightholder may transfer assign or grant usage rights under a contractual license;,policy negotiation
It is important to note that the holder of database rights does not enjoy absolute protection but may only claim a breach of his rights where he has “made available to the public” if a lawful user extracts or re-utilizes other than insubstantial parts of its contents.11,policy negotiation
the data provider does have certain control over the metadata that he/she shares and thus can define or limit the scope of possible conclusions that a data consumer can draw on the data provider’s sensitive business information.,policy negotiation
The benefits of trade secret protection in shared data are obvious as the trade secret owner has actionable rights to request cease and desist against unlawful data usage (i.e. without the trade secret owner’s consent) claim damages against misappropriation of trade secrets etc.17,policy negotiation
Nominate Data Users (if needed),policy negotiation
Receive information about data transaction from Clearing House,policy negotiation
Search for existing datasets by making an inquiry at a Broker Service Provider,policy negotiation
This kind of traceability is similar to the data protection requirements a data controller is confronted with so as to be able to fulfill its data subjects’ right to access.,policy negotiation
It is also closely related to the question of proving compliance with contracts agreements or legal regulations. And data provenance tracking can be used to facilitate clearing in decentralized data ecosystems since it is capable of aggregating information concerning data exchange transactions and data usage.,policy negotiation
By this data provenance tracking maintains a data flow model that keeps track of the particular representations of data items. This kind of information can also be leveraged for data usage control enforcement; i.e. the data flow model is implemented as a Policy Information Point (PIP).,policy negotiation
By creating transparency and offering clearing functionality the International Data Spaces provides a way to track the provenance and lineage of data.,policy negotiation
This is strongly linked to the topics of data ownership and data sovereignty.,policy negotiation
Data provenance tracking can be implemented with local tracking components integrated into IDS Connectors and a centralized provenance storage component attached to the Clearing House (see Chapter 3.1.1) which receives all logs concerning activities performed in the course of a data exchange transaction and requests confirmations of successful data exchange from the Data Provider and the Data Consumer.,policy negotiation
In doing so data provenance is always recursively traceable. In addition provenance information can be integrated into the IDS Vocabulary so as to enable the participants to maintain data provenance as part of the metadata during the process of data exchange.,policy negotiation
A Policy Information Point (PIP) provides missing information for decision-making. In addition such a component can be used to get contextual information for or about the system action intercepted (e.g. data flow information geolocation of the requesting device).,policy enforcement
However while distributed data usage control is concerned with the enforcement of rights and duties when exchanging data across system boundaries the focus of data provenance tracking is on transparency and accountability.,policy enforcement
While a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) serving for distributed data usage control in most cases needs to be able to proactively intercept data usage actions within the control flow (i.e. preventive enforcement) a PEP for data provenance tracking only needs to passively observe interpret and log data exchange transactions and data usage for retrospective examination (in terms of usage control this kind of enforcement is denoted as “detective enforcement”).,policy enforcement
The operating principle of data provenance tracking is very similar to the operating principle of distributed data usage control. Data provenance tracking relies on passive monitoring technology (e.g. PEPs) which deliver events indicating data usage or data flows for being logged. For this a PEP needs to convey a semantic description of the data usage or data flows its events indicate. The data provenance tracking infrastructure provides a data flow tracking component which understands such semantics specifications. The PEP also needs to forward events together with metadata (including a unique identifier of the data’s content) so that logged transactions can be attributed to data content when data provenance is aggregated or queried.,policy enforcement
The Validator checks if the Configuration Model complies with self-defined rules and with general rules specified by the International Data Spaces respectively. Violation of rules can be treated as warnings or errors. If such warnings or errors occur deployment may fail or be rejected.,policy enforcement
Thus users must be aware that data usage control will only provide certain enforcement guarantees if applied on highly trusted platforms such as Trusted Connectors in the International Data Spaces,policy enforcement
With that in mind solutions range from organizational rules or legal contracts to completely technical ways of enforcing usage restrictions. For example an organizational rule (e.g. a company policy) could state that employees must not use removable storage devices such as USB sticks.,policy enforcement
Enforcement of data usage restrictions can be characterized and implemented in different forms. Organizational rules or legal contracts can be substituted or at least accompanied by technical solutions which introduce a new level of security. Vice versa technical solutions can be accompanied by organizational rules or legal contracts (e.g. to compensate missing capabilities of the technical solution).,policy enforcement
Similarly a technical form of enforcement such as group policies specified by the Windows operating system can prevent employees from using removable storage devices. In some scenarios organizational rules legal contracts and technical rules can be used interchangeably. In other scenarios the three forms can be used to complement each other.,policy enforcement
As the International Data Spaces provides an Information Model (see Section 3.1) additional metadata enhances the data transferred via the route thereby enabling better usage control enforcement. The Connector attaches the metadata to the data package as explained in section 3.4. In addition a PIP is able to resolve more metadata during the decision-making process,policy enforcement
The Connector is the main technical component for implementing usage control. Hence usage control enhanced Connectors such as the Trusted Connector contain relevant components to perform usage control enforcement as Data Consumer (PEPs such as the Apache Camel interceptor; PDPs PMPs).,policy enforcement
The data provenance tracking infrastructure provides a data flow tracking component which understands such semantics specifications. The PEP also needs to forward events together with metadata (including a unique identifier of the data’s content) so that logged transactions can be attributed to data content when data provenance is aggregated or queried.,policy enforcement
enforcement) a PEP for data provenance tracking only needs to passively observe interpret and log data exchange transactions and data usage for retrospective examination (in terms of usage control this kind of enforcement is denoted as “detective enforcement”).,policy enforcement
Data provenance tracking is closely related but also complementary to distributed data usage control. It has its origins in the domain of scientific computing where it was introduced to trace the lineage of data. Data provenance tracking thereby allows finding out when how and by whom data was modified and which other,policy enforcement
By means of Data Provenance Tracking (as described in the next section) it is possible to track the usage of data and the enforcement of usage restrictions. The Clearing House is able to use this data later on.,policy enforcement
By nature of how the formation and interpretation of contracts work it is not a trivial task and hence important to manage expectations what semi-automated contracting and contract enforcement can achieve.5,policy enforcement
By putting sample contracts at the disposal of all participants of the ecosystem IDS gives orientation as well as the freedom to create contracts of their own that data providers data brokers and data consumers and any other participants can construe and implement their models for sharing data through licensing agreements of all sorts and kinds without being prescriptive as to the kind and nature of the contractual relations.2,policy negotiation
These Terms of Use are designed to ensure a reasonable balance between the interest of the platform operator and the users (data providers and data consumers) in order to facilitate data transactions and/or operational processes (such as performance of a logistics order and performance process) on the platform.,policy negotiation
Policy negotiation is also part of policy management. As enforcement mechanisms can work differently across different systems or technologies abstract policies may have different instantiations. Hence usage policies must always be instantiated on the target system.,policy negotiation
Again and as stated above the intention of providing template agreements is not about being prescriptive but rather to endorse the overarching principle of freedom of contract whereas trying to reduce the transactional costs of setting up and negotiating suitable contracts for data licensing.89,policy negotiation
Extending the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)46 a W3C standard the Information Model’s Usage Control module provides machine-readable specifications of usage control policies (see section 3.4.4.1.1). These specify actions that a party is prohibited or permitted to do with regard to given a data asset. In addition they codify any potentially involved duties. Despite a simple core model which is depicted in Figure 416 ODRL policies are a formal,policy negotiation

The International Data Spaces neither makes any statements on legal perspectives nor does it restrict participants to any predefined patterns. Instead it offers the possibility to design digital business models individually and as deemed appropriate. 4.3.3 DATA AS AN ECONOMIC GOOD In the material world the difference between the terms “possession” and “property” is an abstract yet necessary construct. It is accepted that moving a good from one place to another and changing possession of the good does not necessarily have an impact on the property rights. Regarding the specific concept of the International Data Spaces it is necessary to take into account that the Data Owner and Data Provider may not be identical (see Chapter 3.1.1). PERSPECTIVES OF THE REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE MODEL // 4.3 1 53 Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union From a legal perspective there is no ownership regarding data as data is an intangible good. With the “Free Flow of Data” Regulation53 the European Commission supports data exchange and data sharing across borders in the means of technical hurdles. The IDS approach supports the implementation of the regulation for non-personal data. At the same time the democratization of data is not the aim of the IDS concept as data ownership is an important aspect when it comes to offering data and negotiating contracts in digital business ecosystems especially because data can easily be duplicated. The International Data Spaces makes sure the need of a Data Provider or a Data Producer is comprehensively addressed by providing a secure and trusted platform for authorization and authentication within a decentralized architecture. This allows Data Providers as well as Service Providers to be identified and controlled by an Identity Provider (see Chapter 3.1.1). Decentralized data exchange by means of Connectors in contrast to other architectures of data networks (e.g. data lakes or cloud services) ensures full data sovereignty. In addition to these self-control mechanisms the architecture allows logging of data transfer information at a Clearing House (see Chapter 3.2.5). As the need for Data Sovereignty is obvious but the term of ownership is not defined for data the term “Data Sovereign” indicates the rights duties and responsibilities for this role. The term and the role of the Data Owner is defined for this document,policy negotiation

Which platform a data owner or data provider will choose to take advantage of will depend on the business criticality and the economic value of the data goods they want to exchange and share.

In simplified terms the key distinctions that any data provider must consider are around the nature of the transaction i.e. whether he/she intends to grant (1) perpetual or temporary (2) exclusive or non-exclusive and (3) royalty-free or paid-up usage rights—and in which combination of each of these aspects.,IDS core participants

What are the restrictions regarding the use of the Resource?,usge control
How much does it cost to use the Resource?,usge control
A formal Constraint may restrict the applicability of a Rule (e.g. by purpose of use) guide the selection of collection items (e.g. according to the file format) and permissible Parties (e.g. by role) or refine the interpretation of Actions (e.g. print at low resolution). The underlying Policy language has to define appropriate properties (e.g. purpose file format role or resolution) along with conditions of their applicability and interpretation37. Reusing quality metrics (e.g. server uptime) as introduced above allows specifying Policies on the required quality of service (QoS).,usge control
A Rule defines Actions that an involved Party is obliged (Duty) permitted (Permission) or prohibited (Prohibition) to do with respect to an Asset.,usge control
Likewise applicable Rules are selected and configured in accordance with the Data Provider’s demand and the Data Consumer’s economic legal and technical options. By agreeing on a Usage Contract the Data Consumer explicitly confirms its capability of implementing and enforcing the stipulated rules.,usge control
For example the ODRL Constraint class expresses logical conditions that govern the applicability of a Rule. Here an Operator (eq) relates the Left Operand (a predicate like absolutePosition) to a Right Operand (dynamic or predefined value).,usge control

The actual access control decision has to be made within the Connector and can be implemented using technologies such as XACML or JAAS depending on the implementation of the Connector. The IDS Security Architecture does not dictate a specific,service contract
Data usage control can be implemented by means of a machine-readable contract which is expected to be fulfilled by a party. It is a way to track and trace data as it is used within different systems and to collect evidence of the violation of agreed usage constraints.,service contract
Similarly a technical form of enforcement such as group policies specified by the Windows operating system can prevent employees from using removable storage devices. In some scenarios organizational rules legal contracts and technical rules can be used interchangeably.,service contract
These specify actions that a party is prohibited or permitted to do with regard to given a data asset. In addition they codify any potentially involved duties.,service contract
ODRL policies are a formal way to declaratively express usage contracts at a specification level. This way the Information Model provides a technology-agnostic consistent representation of usage control policies across the International Data Spaces.,service contract
In complex usage control scenarios such as establishing data sovereignty for managing globally distributed supply chains data is passed on from one Data Consumer to another. Depending on the usage control policy in place data may be forwarded in its original form or it may be somehow processed aggregated or anonymized before being forwarded. This indicates the relevance of establishing transparency concerning data flows and data usage in compliance with usage control policies business contracts or legal regulations. For this purpose distributed data usage control and data provenance tracking complement each other.,service contract

The Community of trust concern considers the fundamental requirement of the International Data Spaces for exchanging and sharing digital content between a Data Provider and a Data Consumer in a secure and trusted way while preserving data sovereignty of the Data Owner.,service contract
A Usage Contract formalizes the expectations regarding the behavior of Participants involved in a data exchange transaction in a declarative technology-agnostic way. It constitutes a unique binding agreement between the Parties on Resource usage conditions as a result of an (automated) negotiation process. Digital Usage Contracts are to be maintained in a safe unforgeable manner (e.g. blockchain). They are the foundation for clearing and configuring the Resource’s access control policies and for perpetual evaluation and enforcement by Usage Control Frameworks like MYDATA Control41.,service contract
“Service Configuration” defines how configuration parameters for Data Services or other Connector components have to be set.,service contract
While the International Data Spaces enables all participants to act in compliance with negotiated rules and processes it does not make any restrictions or enforce predefined regulations. The architecture of the International Data Spaces should be seen as a functional framework providing mechanisms that can be customized by the participating organizations according to their individual requirements.,service contract
Providing a dynamic view of the architecture the Process Layer (see Chapter 3.3) describes the interactions taking place between the different components of the International Data Spaces. The three major processes described in the Process Layer section (onboarding exchanging data and publishing and using Data Apps) are directly related to the Governance Perspective as they define its scope regarding the technical architecture.,service contract
It thereby defines a framework for standardized collaboration and for using the infrastructure of the International Data Spaces for establishing individual agreements and contracts.,service contract
The International Data Spaces makes sure the need of a Data Provider or a Data Producer is comprehensively addressed by providing a secure and trusted platform for authorization and authentication within a decentralized architecture.,service contract
Any such authorization should be documented by a contract which should include data usage policy information for the data provided (see. Section 4.1.3.6). The contract needs not necessarily be a paper document but may be an electronic file as well.,service contract
that a data provider and/or data broker wishes to share with them under which purposes and for which duration.,service provider
In essence any provider of structured data should examine whether he/she can claim the database rights. If so the rightholder should consider all options for granting licenses in the database as well as safeguarding his/her legal position against unwanted modifications and alterations which could result in the creation of new sui generis rights.13,service provider
To give a practical example the owner of a steel mill that shares runtime data of his/her machines in real time is providing considerable transparency about his/her current level of bandwidth and manufacturing capacity at any given point in time.,service provider
He/she will want to avoid that this information is disclosed to his/her competitors and/or intermediaries who might use the information to influence market pricing.,service provider
In other words it is important to understand that the data provider cannot necessarily maintain control over what a data consumer makes out of the data that he/she provides.,service provider
In essence a data provider can claim trade secret protection for “information... which...is secret in the sense that it is not as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components generally known among or readily accessible to personal with the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question... and has commercial value because it is secret...and has been subject to reasonable steps...to keep it secret.”,service provider
The roles of data providers (acting as the [original] data controllers)67,service provider
A data provider must therefore determine (and document internally) before sharing it whether certain data has commercial value because it is secret and which protective measures the data provider has taken to keep it secret (such as limited access internally on a need to know basis technical security measures etc.).,service provider
The data provider will need to assess the legal basis for making the data available to the data consumer under Art. 6 GDPR (e.g. consent of the data subject performance of a contract with the data subject legitimate interest) and ensure compliance with further obligations of a data controller (e.g. privacy notice under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR;,service provider
That said it is equally possible that data providers can do without the services of a platform provider if and where they simply draw on the IDS connector technology and organize the data exchange (1:1 or 1:n) by themselves.,service provider

having the (technical) means and the responsibility to define Usage Contracts and Usage Policies and to provide access to data; and,service provider
Usually a participant acting as Data Owner automatically assumes the role of the Data Provider as well. However there may be cases in which the Data Provider is not the Data Owner (e.g. if the data is technically managed by a different entity than the Data Owner such as in the case of a company using an external IT service provider for data management or if data,service provider
The Data Provider makes data available for being exchanged between a Data Owner and a Data Consumer. As already mentioned above the Data Provider is in most cases identical with the Data Owner but not necessarily. To submit metadata to a Broker or exchange data with a Data Consumer the Data Provider uses software components that are compliant with the Reference Architecture Model of the International Data Spaces.,service provider
Exchanging data with a Data Consumer needs not necessarily be the only activity of the Data Provider. At the end of a data exchange transaction completely or partially executed for example the Data Provider may log the details of the successful (or unsuccessful) completion of the transaction at a Clearing House (see below) to facilitate billing or resolve a conflict. Furthermore the Data Provider can use Data Apps to enrich or transform the data in some way or to improve its quality. (Data Apps are specific applications that can be integrated into the data exchange workflow between two or more participants in the International Data Spaces.),service provider
The management of usage policies becomes especially important when data is to be exchanged across system boundaries. Every time data crosses system boundaries the target system must be prepared for the protection of incoming data (i.e. it has to deploy the corresponding policy).,usge control
In order to implement and enforce usage policies at a specification level within individual target environments it is necessary to map organizational and technical measures to the individual target environments. While organizational measures are out of scope here technical measures involve a variety of additional information sources (PIPs) and tight integration with the host environment (PEPs).,usge control
This way the Information Model provides a technology-agnostic consistent representation of usage control policies across the International Data Spaces.,usge control
The Policy determines the conditions for using the Resource including Pricing in a formal way supporting contract negotiation and (automated) contract enforcement.,usge control
Alongside with data access control regulating access to specific digital resources (e.g. a service or a file) the IDS Security Architecture also supports data usage control. In general the overall goal is to enforce data usage restrictions on the Data Consumer side after access to data has been granted.,usge control
Usage control is an extension of access control (see figure 4.11). It is about the specification and enforcement of restrictions regulating what may be done with a data asset and what not. Thus usage control is concerned with requirements that pertain to data processing (obligations) rather than data access (provisions). Usage control is relevant in the context of intellectual property protection regulatory compliance and digital rights management.,usge control
Data usage control in the IDS basically works by attaching data usage policy information to data being exchanged and continuously controlling the way data is processed aggregated or forwarded to other endpoints. This data-centric perspective allows Data Providers to continuously control data flows rather than accesses to services. At configuration time data usage policies support developers and administrators in setting up correct data flows.,usge control
At runtime data usage control enforcement prevents IDS Connectors from handling data in an undesired way (for example by forwarding personal data to public endpoints). Thus data usage control is both a tool for system integrators to ensure they are not building an architecture that violates security requirements and an audit mechanism providing evidence of compliant data usage.,usge control
It is important to note that the purpose of data usage control is to allow the specification of such constraints and enforcing them in the respective system.,usge control
Extending the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)46 a W3C standard the Information Model’s Usage Control module provides machine-readable specifications of usage control policies,usge control
the PEPs used for usage control (detective enforcement) can also serve as a basis for data provenance tracking whereas in turn data provenance information can be fed back into usage control enforcement (i.e. a usage control PDP can query for all locations of representations of some given data content protected by a usage control policy).,usge control
Set of rules specified by the Data Owner restricting usage of its data; covers aspects like time-to-live or forwarding conditions (e.g. anonymization or scope of usage); transmitted along with the respective data and enforced while residing on the Connector of the Data Consumer,usge control
Usage Policies originally published alongside with a Resource (Contract Offer) are the starting point of a Contract negotiation process. Over the course of this process any incomplete or newly agreed details regarding Resource exchange are complemented such as the identification of the Resource content in question communication Endpoints authorization token(s) or the provisioning period.,usge control
The concept of data usage control allows Data Providers to attach data usage policy information to their data in order to define how a Data Consumer may use the data.,usge control
A precondition of data usage control is that the enforcement mechanism itself is trusted; i.e. data usage control itself does not establish trust in an endpoint but rather builds upon an existing trust relationship and facilitates enforcement of legal or technical requirements such,usge control
The Governance Perspective of the Reference Architecture Model defines the roles functions and processes of the International Data Spaces from a governance and compliance point of view. It thereby defines the requirements to be met by the business ecosystem to achieve secure and reliable corporate interoperability.,usge control
Yet the vision of IDS is right and the implementation requires a legal framework that includes and supports the implementation of technical usage control. With that usage control will have a stronger effect than the traditional licensing models.,usge control
in compliance with general and specific regulations ranging from anti-trust to GDPR and cyber-security regulations as well as sector specific regulations.,data protection law
allowing personal data to be used with the help of a personal data sharing intermediary that safeguards data subjects’ rights under the GDPR;,data protection law
With its definition of personal data the GDPR has determined an ample scope: “personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name an identification number location data on online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical physiological genetic mental economic cultural or social identity of that natural person.”,data protection law
Anonymization of personal data can enable a data controller to further process the data without considering the data protection requirements provided that the data is no longer related to an identified or identifiable person.64,data protection law
Please note that pseudonymization of personal data (replacing identifiable personal data by a pseudonym) is reversible and can therefore only be used as an additional security safeguard for the processing.,data protection law
In addition the rise of Big Data and AI has clearly shown that what might appear at a given point in time as anonymous data or other data with no connection or relevance to natural persons may actually turn out to be an element of personal data once it is combined with other identifiers.66,data protection law
Any concept regarding data spaces such as IDS must therefore be prepared to cater for compliance requirements regarding both personal and non-personal data.,data protection law
separately—which may result in different legal basis applying depending on the nature of processing the various data consumers envision.,data protection law
The EU Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data74 has two core objectives: ensuring the free movement of non-personal data across Member State borders i.e. removing data localization requirements between Member States (and preserving availability and access to data for regulatory control purposes)75,data protection law
Accordingly data licensing agreements do not yet follow general common standards that practitioners can “pull off the shelf” such as in the world of software licensing. In any event therefore it is helpful to be aware of the fundamentally different types of contractual,data protection law
Obviously any participant in an IDS-based data exchange must be aware and ensure to take the appropriate measures to act in compliance with applicable laws in particular with mandatory rules of data protection law (GDPR),data protection law
The GDPR applies at any time where data providers share personal data i.e. “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name an identification number,data protection law
location data an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical physiological genetic mental economic cultural or social identity of that natural person” 91 triggering all the relevant provisions regarding a legal basis92 and its limitations on purpose variation93 and transparency through privacy notices94 ensuring data subjects rights95 documentation requirements96 and breach notifications.97,data protection law
Where personal data breaches occur the data controller(s) will need to assess the risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects and if so notify within 72 h the competent data protection authority and in case of significant risks also the data subjects.103,data protection law
GDPR—respectively assess in the first place if and to which extent it is willing and capable to process personal data in light of those requirements or determine that its data contributions and data exchange shall exclude personal data from the outset.,data protection law
This kind of traceability is similar to the data protection requirements a data controller is confronted with so as to be able to fulfill its data subjects’ right to access. It is also closely related to the question of proving compliance with contracts agreements or legal regulations. And data provenance tracking can be used to facilitate clearing in decentralized data ecosystems since it is capable of aggregating information concerning data exchange transactions and data usage.,data protection law
It thereby supports the requirements to be met by the actors within the ecosystem to achieve secure and reliable interoperability as well as desirable behavior regarding the use of data.,data protection law
The Business Layer (see Chapter 3.1) facilitates the development and use of new digital business models to be applied by the Participants in the International Data Spaces. It also specifies the roles within the IDS. Thereby it is directly related to the Governance Perspective by considering the business point of view regarding data ownership data provision and data consumption and by describing core service concepts such as data brokerage.,data protection law

It is indisputable that data has a value and that data management generates costs. Today data is traded in the market like a commodity; it has a price and many companies monitor the costs incurred for data management. However data being an intangible good differs from tangible goods with regard to a number of properties among which the fact that data is non-rival is considered the most important one.,asset
Depending on what type data is of or what category it can be subsumed under the value it contributes to the development of innovative products and services can vary. Therefore the need for protection of data is not the same across all data types and data categories. Public data for example which can be accessed by anyone requires a lower level of protection than private data or club data.,asset
ASSET An Asset is the subject of a Rule a Resource or a collection of Resources. Depending on the Policy’s specifications (e.g. do not redistribute) the Asset’s content needs to be identified in a persistent and unambiguous manner in order to be effectively enforceable independently of the provisioning type (e.g. download URL) or storage context (Data Provider or Data Consumer) (for example by an identifier composed of indicators such as artifact name and hash sum).,asset

To find that balance it is important to take a close look at the data itself as not all data requires the same level of protection and as the value contribution of data varies depending on what class or category it can be subsumed under.,data sovereignty
In fact the path toward parameterizing different types of contracts and ascertaining related contractual remedies under a governing law (to be selected) bears a multitude of complexities which need to be further explored.,governing law
Under current law the most notable (yet largely unknown and underestimated) legal instrument available and applied to collections of data is the right of the database maker as provided under the EU Database Directive 96/9/EC and implemented in each EU Member State.6,governing law
The database right protects the investment into the systematical and methodical order of a collection of data in order to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of the database7,governing law
In addition to the tools of usage control and confidentiality agreements however it is important to consider the scope and inherent limitations under the EU Trade Secrets Directive (EU) 2016/943 and its varying implementation into national law of the EU Member States.,governing law
Together with this ambitious claim the EU Commission has presented its EU Data Strategy as a cornerstone to a wider framework of existing and upcoming regulation.26,governing law
The EU Commission has set important milestones for transforming the single market into a digitally enabled market and making the EU “leading in a data-driven society” and empowering “people businesses and organisations ... to make better decisions based on insights from non-personal data which should be available to all” 24 and creating a “data-agile economy.”,governing law
The EU Data Strategy envisions three fundamental objectives namely (1) the free flow of data within the EU and across sectors; (2) full respect of European rules and values including in particular personal data protection consumer protection and competition law; and (3) fair practical and clear rules for fair access and use of data based on trustworthy data governance mechanisms.27,governing law
importance of data spaces as part of the first pillar (1) aiming to “enable a legislative framework of the governance of common European data spaces” 29 as well as providing significant investment and funding in High Impact Projects on European data spaces and federated cloud infrastructures.30,governing law
As part of its data space strategy the EU Commission has identified the following sectors where it intends to create “Common European data spaces”: industrial/ manufacturing Green Deal mobility health financial energy agriculture public administration and skills.33 In other words IDS represents a role model if not a blueprint for these sectors to prepare and develop—in an active dialogue with the relevant stakeholders—the related data space implementations in accordance with the EU Data Strategy.,governing law
The Data Governance Act of May 30 202234 is a pillar in the EU Data Strategy and will be complemented by the European Data Act to foster data sharing among businesses and between business and governments35 and stands next to the Digital Markets Act36 and the Digital Services Act.37 It contains key elements of regulation for operators of data spaces.,governing law
The Data Governance Act accentuates the role and provides notification obligations for providers of data sharing services (“data intermediaries”) in an approach to create a European model for data sharing of personal and non-personal data through “neutral data intermediaries” as an alternative to the current prevalence and market,governing law
From an institutional perspective the Data Governance Act will create a “European Data Innovation Board” consisting of representatives of the Member States the EU Commission and representatives of relevant data spaces and specific sectors (e.g. health agriculture transport and statistics).47,governing law
As for data held by the public sector the Data Governance Act establishes a few key principles: generally public sector bodies shall not enter into exclusive agreements for the re-use of data they hold nor may they restrict the availability of the data for re-use unless (as an exception to the rule) where a data consumer receives exclusive rights for a maximum of 3 years in order to provide a service or product in the general interest and under a national concession issued in accordance with general transparency principles.49,governing law
The Data Governance Act requires data intermediaries to follow a notification procedure in regard to the following types of intermediation services: (1) between data holders (as legal persons) and data consumers both in bilateral or multilateral data exchanges or the creation of platforms or databases that enable the exchange or joint exploitation of data as well as the establishment of a specific infrastructure for the interconnection of data holders and data consumers;,governing law
between data subjects that want to make their personal data available and potential data consumers thereby facilitating the data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR; and,governing law
services of data cooperatives particularly in the areas of micro small and mid-size enterprises.52 The concept of notification does not imply an approval by the authorities53 but rather provides a mechanism to determine certain conditions for data intermediary services (before commencing their activity)54 and to establish a supervisory control over an intermediary’s compliance with such conditions55 which can impose “dissuasive financial penalties” (to be further defined by the Member States) if need be.56,governing law
While the following explanations stand against the background of German law (and hence need to bear in mind that underlying statutory law can impact the formation and interpretation of contracts) they are to a considerable degree generic in nature and can be applied to other jurisdictions (even if adaptations under local law remain indispensable).,governing law
choice of governing law and dispute resolution.,governing law
From a German legal perspective (which can at least be helpful also for other civil law jurisdictions) the categorization of contract types can help in this regard (Fig. 5.2).,governing law
It supports collaborative governance mechanisms so that the common service and value propositions are achieved while protecting the interests of all actors.,governing law
As innovative business models and digital data-driven services require enhanced data management capabilities the role of data governance is increasingly receiving attention.,governing law
To manage data under consideration of business needs and the existing digital infrastructure data governance being a leadership function of data management acts as an enabler for successfully engaging in a collaborative ecosystem.,governing law
Therefore the management of data related resources by means of decision rights accountabilities roles and ownership makes data governance a fundamental element in the International Data Spaces ecosystem.,governing law
They ensure that relevant guidelines and principles regarding data assets are in place and monitored. However traditional instruments for assigning decision rights and accountabilities in terms of data usually do not reach beyond an organization’s borders. Thus the influence of authority for the individual actor within a data ecosystem might be limited. The IDS-RAM addresses this challenge in a federated manner by distributing decision rights for data governance and management activities to the different roles in the International Data Spaces ecosystem.,governing law
As the International Data Spaces intends to build upon and apply existing law it will not include any purely technology-oriented solutions to prevent data duplication or misuse of data assets.,governing law
The International Data Spaces thereby supports the concrete implementation of applicable law without predefining conditions from a business point of view by providing a technical framework that can be customized to the needs of individual participants.,governing law
Data Owners define attribute-based access control policies for their endpoints. In addition they define the attribute values a subject must attest in order to grant access to the resource.,IDS core participants
A Participant is a legal or natural person assuming a role (or more than one role) in the International Data Spaces. Participants must undergo a formal certification process.,IDS core participants
Core components to be used in the IDS must provide the required functionality and level of security. The certification of core components focuses on interoperability and security while aiming to strengthen the development and maintenance process of these components.,IDS core participants
To build this trust in a structured way the International Data Spaces has established a well-defined process for core component certification. An in-depth description of the certification process and how it applies to the key elements of the IDS architecture can be found in Part 3 of the White Paper Certification. The core component certification criteria catalogue is available for free to all IDSA members.,IDS core participants
Actors in the market can make use of the International Data Spaces standard for providing software services and technology to the market.,IDS core participants
The Business Layer of the Reference Architecture Model defines and categorizes the different roles the participants in the International Data Spaces may assume. Furthermore it specifies basic patterns of interaction taking place between these roles. It thereby contributes to the development of innovative business models and digital data-driven services to be used by the participants in the International Data Spaces.,IDS core participants
Core Participants are involved and required every time data is exchanged in the International Data Spaces. Roles assigned to this category are Data Owner Data Provider Data Consumer Data User and App Provider. The role of a Core Participant can be assumed by any organization that owns wants to provide and/or wants to consume or use data.,IDS core participants
Benefit for participants in the International Data Spaces is created by these roles as they make data available (Data Owner) provide data (Data Provider) or consume/use data (Data Consumer Data User App Provider). In addition Data Providers and Data Consumers may apply business models (including pricing models) as deemed appropriate.,IDS core participants
As the legal situation regarding data ownership is very complicated (as discussed in section 4.3.4) the term ‘Data Owner’ is not used in a legal understanding in this document.,IDS core participants
The Reference Architecture Model takes an operational data management perspective defining a Data Owner as a legal entity or natural person creating data and/or executing control over it. This enables the Data Owner to define Data Usage Policies and provide access to its data.,IDS core participants
TThe Data Provider makes data available for being exchanged between a Data Owner and a Data Consumer. As already mentioned above the Data Provider is in most cases identical with the Data Owner but not necessarily. To submit metadata to a Broker or exchange data with a Data Consumer the Data Provider uses software components that are compliant with the Reference Architecture Model of the International Data Spaces.,IDS core participants
Providing a Data Consumer with data from a Data Owner is the main activity of the Data Provider. To facilitate a data request from a Data Consumer the Data Provider should provide a Broker Service Provider (see below) with proper metadata about the data. However a Broker Service Provider is not necessarily required for a Data Consumer and a Data Provider to establish a connection.,IDS core participants
The Data Consumer receives data from a Data Provider. From a business process modeling perspective the Data Consumer is the mirror entity of the Data Provider; the activities performed by the Data Consumer are therefore similar to the activities performed by the Data Provider.,IDS core participants
Like a Data Provider the Data Consumer may log the details of a successful (or unsuccessful) data exchange transaction at a Clearing House use Data Apps to enrich transform etc. the data received or use a Service Provider to connect to the International Data Spaces (if it does not deploy the technical infrastructure for participation itself).,IDS core participants
Similar to the Data Owner being the legal entity that has the legal control over its data the Data User is the legal entity that has the legal right to use the data of a Data Owner as specified by the usage policy. In most cases the Data User is identical with the Data Consumer. However there may be scenarios in,IDS core participants
which these roles are assumed by different participants. For example a patient could use a web-based software system to manage their personal health data and grant access to this data to a health coach. The data could be received from a hospital. In this case the health coach would be the Data User and the provider of the web-based software system would be the Data Consumer.,IDS core participants
App Providers develop Data Apps to be used in the International Data Spaces. To be deployable a Data App has to be compliant with the system architecture of the International Data Spaces (see Section 3.5). In addition Data Apps can be certified by a Certification Body in order to increase trust in these applications (especially with regard to Data Apps processing sensitive information). Each Data App must be published in the App Store for being accessed and used by Data Consumers and Data Providers. App Providers should describe each Data App using metadata (in compliance with a metadata model) with regard to its semantics functionality interfaces etc.).,IDS core participants
Enforcement of data usage rules on the connector (external criteria): position time legal requirements,policy negotiation
To enforce data usage restrictions a system’s actions need to be monitored and potentially intercepted by control points (i.e. Policy Enforcement Points PEPs). These actions must be judged by a decision engine (i.e. a Policy Decision Point PDP) for requesting permission or denial. In addition to just allowing or denying an action the decision engine may also require modification of the action. A PEP component encapsulates the enforcement.,policy negotiation
Data usage control can be implemented by means of a machine-readable contract which is expected to be fulfilled by a party. It is a way to track and trace data as it is used within different systems and to collect evidence of the violation of agreed usage constraints. With that in mind solutions range from organizational rules or legal contracts to completely technical ways of enforcing usage restrictions. For example an organizational rule (e.g. a company policy) could state that employees must not use removable storage devices such as USB sticks.,policy negotiation
Similarly a technical form of enforcement such as group policies specified by the Windows operating system can prevent employees from using removable storage devices. In some scenarios organizational rules legal contracts and technical rules can be used interchangeably. In other scenarios the three forms can be used to complement each other. In the long run it can be expected that organizational rules and legal contracts will increasingly be replaced by technical forms of enforcement,policy negotiation
The policy decision may also depend on additional information that is not present in the intercepted system action itself. This includes information about the context such as data flows or the geographical location of an entity. It is also possible to specify pre- or post-conditions that have to hold before (e.g. integrity check of the environment) and after (e.g. data item is deleted after usage) decision-making. In addition it is possible to define on-conditions that have to hold during usage (e.g. only during business hours). These conditions usually specify constraints and permissions that have to be fulfilled before during and after using data,policy negotiation
Another important aspect of data usage control is the specification and management of usage restrictions. Data Providers have to express data usage restrictions in a more or less formal way. For technical enforcement the specification must produce a machine-readable output.,policy negotiation
Usage restriction policy information can be attached to the data that is about to be exchanged. This type of policy is called sticky policy45. Following this approach data is encrypted before it is sent to a Data Consumer and it can only be decrypted if the Data Consumer fully and explicitly accepts the usage restrictions specified.,policy negotiation
A usage restriction policy can be stored independently of the data it relates to (for instance in a central component such as a PMP/PRP). In this case the management component has the responsibility to exchange usage restriction information between different systems.,policy negotiation
For example the ODRL Constraint class expresses logical conditions that govern the applicability of a Rule.,policy negotiation
In addition Connectors as Data Providers should provide the technology-dependent policies to the data they provide – for all kinds of systems and enforcement technologies that are part of the ecosystem.,policy negotiation

It is important to note that the holder of database rights does not enjoy absolute protection but may only claim a breach of his rights where he has “made available to the public” if a lawful user extracts or re-utilizes other than insubstantial parts of its contents.11,policy negotiation
the data provider does have certain control over the metadata that he/she shares and thus can define or limit the scope of possible conclusions that a data consumer can draw on the data provider’s sensitive business information.,policy negotiation
The benefits of trade secret protection in shared data are obvious as the trade secret owner has actionable rights to request cease and desist against unlawful data usage (i.e. without the trade secret owner’s consent) claim damages against misappropriation of trade secrets etc.17,policy negotiation

This kind of traceability is similar to the data protection requirements a data controller is confronted with so as to be able to fulfill its data subjects’ right to access.,policy negotiation
It is also closely related to the question of proving compliance with contracts agreements or legal regulations. And data provenance tracking can be used to facilitate clearing in decentralized data ecosystems since it is capable of aggregating information concerning data exchange transactions and data usage.,policy negotiation
By this data provenance tracking maintains a data flow model that keeps track of the particular representations of data items. This kind of information can also be leveraged for data usage control enforcement; i.e. the data flow model is implemented as a Policy Information Point (PIP).,policy negotiation
By creating transparency and offering clearing functionality the International Data Spaces provides a way to track the provenance and lineage of data.,policy negotiation
This is strongly linked to the topics of data ownership and data sovereignty.,policy negotiation
Data provenance tracking can be implemented with local tracking components integrated into IDS Connectors and a centralized provenance storage component attached to the Clearing House (see Chapter 3.1.1) which receives all logs concerning activities performed in the course of a data exchange transaction and requests confirmations of successful data exchange from the Data Provider and the Data Consumer.,policy negotiation
In doing so data provenance is always recursively traceable. In addition provenance information can be integrated into the IDS Vocabulary so as to enable the participants to maintain data provenance as part of the metadata during the process of data exchange.,policy negotiation
A Policy Information Point (PIP) provides missing information for decision-making. In addition such a component can be used to get contextual information for or about the system action intercepted (e.g. data flow information geolocation of the requesting device).,policy enforcement
However while distributed data usage control is concerned with the enforcement of rights and duties when exchanging data across system boundaries the focus of data provenance tracking is on transparency and accountability.,policy enforcement
While a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) serving for distributed data usage control in most cases needs to be able to proactively intercept data usage actions within the control flow (i.e. preventive enforcement) a PEP for data provenance tracking only needs to passively observe interpret and log data exchange transactions and data usage for retrospective examination (in terms of usage control this kind of enforcement is denoted as “detective enforcement”).,policy enforcement
The operating principle of data provenance tracking is very similar to the operating principle of distributed data usage control. Data provenance tracking relies on passive monitoring technology (e.g. PEPs) which deliver events indicating data usage or data flows for being logged. For this a PEP needs to convey a semantic description of the data usage or data flows its events indicate. The data provenance tracking infrastructure provides a data flow tracking component which understands such semantics specifications. The PEP also needs to forward events together with metadata (including a unique identifier of the data’s content) so that logged transactions can be attributed to data content when data provenance is aggregated or queried.,policy enforcement
The Validator checks if the Configuration Model complies with self-defined rules and with general rules specified by the International Data Spaces respectively. Violation of rules can be treated as warnings or errors. If such warnings or errors occur deployment may fail or be rejected.,policy enforcement
Thus users must be aware that data usage control will only provide certain enforcement guarantees if applied on highly trusted platforms such as Trusted Connectors in the International Data Spaces,policy enforcement
With that in mind solutions range from organizational rules or legal contracts to completely technical ways of enforcing usage restrictions. For example an organizational rule (e.g. a company policy) could state that employees must not use removable storage devices such as USB sticks.,policy enforcement
Enforcement of data usage restrictions can be characterized and implemented in different forms. Organizational rules or legal contracts can be substituted or at least accompanied by technical solutions which introduce a new level of security. Vice versa technical solutions can be accompanied by organizational rules or legal contracts (e.g. to compensate missing capabilities of the technical solution).,policy enforcement
Similarly a technical form of enforcement such as group policies specified by the Windows operating system can prevent employees from using removable storage devices. In some scenarios organizational rules legal contracts and technical rules can be used interchangeably. In other scenarios the three forms can be used to complement each other.,policy enforcement
As the International Data Spaces provides an Information Model (see Section 3.1) additional metadata enhances the data transferred via the route thereby enabling better usage control enforcement. The Connector attaches the metadata to the data package as explained in section 3.4. In addition a PIP is able to resolve more metadata during the decision-making process,policy enforcement
The Connector is the main technical component for implementing usage control. Hence usage control enhanced Connectors such as the Trusted Connector contain relevant components to perform usage control enforcement as Data Consumer (PEPs such as the Apache Camel interceptor; PDPs PMPs).,policy enforcement
The data provenance tracking infrastructure provides a data flow tracking component which understands such semantics specifications. The PEP also needs to forward events together with metadata (including a unique identifier of the data’s content) so that logged transactions can be attributed to data content when data provenance is aggregated or queried.,policy enforcement
enforcement) a PEP for data provenance tracking only needs to passively observe interpret and log data exchange transactions and data usage for retrospective examination (in terms of usage control this kind of enforcement is denoted as “detective enforcement”).,policy enforcement
Data provenance tracking is closely related but also complementary to distributed data usage control. It has its origins in the domain of scientific computing where it was introduced to trace the lineage of data. Data provenance tracking thereby allows finding out when how and by whom data was modified and which other,policy enforcement
By means of Data Provenance Tracking (as described in the next section) it is possible to track the usage of data and the enforcement of usage restrictions. The Clearing House is able to use this data later on.,policy enforcement
By nature of how the formation and interpretation of contracts work it is not a trivial task and hence important to manage expectations what semi-automated contracting and contract enforcement can achieve.5,policy enforcement
By putting sample contracts at the disposal of all participants of the ecosystem IDS gives orientation as well as the freedom to create contracts of their own that data providers data brokers and data consumers and any other participants can construe and implement their models for sharing data through licensing agreements of all sorts and kinds without being prescriptive as to the kind and nature of the contractual relations.2,policy negotiation
These Terms of Use are designed to ensure a reasonable balance between the interest of the platform operator and the users (data providers and data consumers) in order to facilitate data transactions and/or operational processes (such as performance of a logistics order and performance process) on the platform.,policy negotiation
Policy negotiation is also part of policy management. As enforcement mechanisms can work differently across different systems or technologies abstract policies may have different instantiations. Hence usage policies must always be instantiated on the target system.,policy negotiation
Again and as stated above the intention of providing template agreements is not about being prescriptive but rather to endorse the overarching principle of freedom of contract whereas trying to reduce the transactional costs of setting up and negotiating suitable contracts for data licensing.89,policy negotiation
Extending the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)46 a W3C standard the Information Model’s Usage Control module provides machine-readable specifications of usage control policies (see section 3.4.4.1.1). These specify actions that a party is prohibited or permitted to do with regard to given a data asset. In addition they codify any potentially involved duties. Despite a simple core model which is depicted in Figure 416 ODRL policies are a formal,policy negotiation

In doing so it is possible to specify access and usage control policies in a way that these are understood by all Participants. The same is true for access control requirements defining minimum security profiles which must be met before access is granted.,policy negotiation

The International Data Spaces neither makes any statements on legal perspectives nor does it restrict participants to any predefined patterns. Instead it offers the possibility to design digital business models individually and as deemed appropriate. 4.3.3 DATA AS AN ECONOMIC GOOD In the material world the difference between the terms “possession” and “property” is an abstract yet necessary construct. It is accepted that moving a good from one place to another and changing possession of the good does not necessarily have an impact on the property rights. Regarding the specific concept of the International Data Spaces it is necessary to take into account that the Data Owner and Data Provider may not be identical (see Chapter 3.1.1). PERSPECTIVES OF THE REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE MODEL // 4.3 1 53 Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union From a legal perspective there is no ownership regarding data as data is an intangible good. With the “Free Flow of Data” Regulation53 the European Commission supports data exchange and data sharing across borders in the means of technical hurdles. The IDS approach supports the implementation of the regulation for non-personal data. At the same time the democratization of data is not the aim of the IDS concept as data ownership is an important aspect when it comes to offering data and negotiating contracts in digital business ecosystems especially because data can easily be duplicated. The International Data Spaces makes sure the need of a Data Provider or a Data Producer is comprehensively addressed by providing a secure and trusted platform for authorization and authentication within a decentralized architecture. This allows Data Providers as well as Service Providers to be identified and controlled by an Identity Provider (see Chapter 3.1.1). Decentralized data exchange by means of Connectors in contrast to other architectures of data networks (e.g. data lakes or cloud services) ensures full data sovereignty. In addition to these self-control mechanisms the architecture allows logging of data transfer information at a Clearing House (see Chapter 3.2.5). As the need for Data Sovereignty is obvious but the term of ownership is not defined for data the term “Data Sovereign” indicates the rights duties and responsibilities for this role. The term and the role of the Data Owner is defined for this document,policy negotiation

In simplified terms the key distinctions that any data provider must consider are around the nature of the transaction i.e. whether he/she intends to grant (1) perpetual or temporary (2) exclusive or non-exclusive and (3) royalty-free or paid-up usage rights—and in which combination of each of these aspects.,IDS core participants

How much does it cost to use the Resource?,usge control
A formal Constraint may restrict the applicability of a Rule (e.g. by purpose of use) guide the selection of collection items (e.g. according to the file format) and permissible Parties (e.g. by role) or refine the interpretation of Actions (e.g. print at low resolution). The underlying Policy language has to define appropriate properties (e.g. purpose file format role or resolution) along with conditions of their applicability and interpretation37. Reusing quality metrics (e.g. server uptime) as introduced above allows specifying Policies on the required quality of service (QoS).,usge control
A Rule defines Actions that an involved Party is obliged (Duty) permitted (Permission) or prohibited (Prohibition) to do with respect to an Asset.,usge control
Likewise applicable Rules are selected and configured in accordance with the Data Provider’s demand and the Data Consumer’s economic legal and technical options. By agreeing on a Usage Contract the Data Consumer explicitly confirms its capability of implementing and enforcing the stipulated rules.,usge control
For example the ODRL Constraint class expresses logical conditions that govern the applicability of a Rule. Here an Operator (eq) relates the Left Operand (a predicate like absolutePosition) to a Right Operand (dynamic or predefined value).,usge control

In complex usage control scenarios such as establishing data sovereignty for managing globally distributed supply chains data is passed on from one Data Consumer to another. Depending on the usage control policy in place data may be forwarded in its original form or it may be somehow processed aggregated or anonymized before being forwarded. This indicates the relevance of establishing transparency concerning data flows and data usage in compliance with usage control policies business contracts or legal regulations.

A Usage Contract formalizes the expectations regarding the behavior of Participants involved in a data exchange transaction in a declarative technology-agnostic way. It constitutes a unique binding agreement between the Parties on Resource usage conditions as a result of an (automated) negotiation process. Digital Usage Contracts are to be maintained in a safe unforgeable manner (e.g. blockchain). They are the foundation for clearing and configuring the Resource’s access control policies and for perpetual evaluation and enforcement by Usage Control Frameworks like MYDATA Control41.,service contract
“Service Configuration” defines how configuration parameters for Data Services or other Connector components have to be set.,service contract
While the International Data Spaces enables all participants to act in compliance with negotiated rules and processes it does not make any restrictions or enforce predefined regulations. The architecture of the International Data Spaces should be seen as a functional framework providing mechanisms that can be customized by the participating organizations according to their individual requirements.,service contract
Providing a dynamic view of the architecture the Process Layer (see Chapter 3.3) describes the interactions taking place between the different components of the International Data Spaces. The three major processes described in the Process Layer section (onboarding exchanging data and publishing and using Data Apps) are directly related to the Governance Perspective as they define its scope regarding the technical architecture.,service contract
It thereby defines a framework for standardized collaboration and for using the infrastructure of the International Data Spaces for establishing individual agreements and contracts.,service contract
The International Data Spaces makes sure the need of a Data Provider or a Data Producer is comprehensively addressed by providing a secure and trusted platform for authorization and authentication within a decentralized architecture.,service contract
Any such authorization should be documented by a contract which should include data usage policy information for the data provided (see. Section 4.1.3.6). The contract needs not necessarily be a paper document but may be an electronic file as well.,service contract

In essence any provider of structured data should examine whether he/she can claim the database rights. If so the rightholder should consider all options for granting licenses in the database as well as safeguarding his/her legal position against unwanted modifications and alterations which could result in the creation of new sui generis rights.13,service provider
To give a practical example the owner of a steel mill that shares runtime data of his/her machines in real time is providing considerable transparency about his/her current level of bandwidth and manufacturing capacity at any given point in time.,service provider
He/she will want to avoid that this information is disclosed to his/her competitors and/or intermediaries who might use the information to influence market pricing.,service provider
In other words it is important to understand that the data provider cannot necessarily maintain control over what a data consumer makes out of the data that he/she provides.,service provider
In essence a data provider can claim trade secret protection for “information... which...is secret in the sense that it is not as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components generally known among or readily accessible to personal with the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question... and has commercial value because it is secret...and has been subject to reasonable steps...to keep it secret.”,service provider
The roles of data providers (acting as the [original] data controllers)67,service provider
A data provider must therefore determine (and document internally) before sharing it whether certain data has commercial value because it is secret and which protective measures the data provider has taken to keep it secret (such as limited access internally on a need to know basis technical security measures etc.).,service provider
The data provider will need to assess the legal basis for making the data available to the data consumer under Art. 6 GDPR (e.g. consent of the data subject performance of a contract with the data subject legitimate interest) and ensure compliance with further obligations of a data controller (e.g. privacy notice under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR;,service provider
That said it is equally possible that data providers can do without the services of a platform provider if and where they simply draw on the IDS connector technology and organize the data exchange (1:1 or 1:n) by themselves.,service provider
data provider needs to consider the legal consequences and risks involved when setting his/her contract terms against that background.,service provider

The Data Provider may attach metadata to the data transferred using the IDS Vocabulary. In doing so the terms and conditions to ensure data sovereignty can be defined unambiguously (e.g. data usage pricing information payment entitlement or time of validity).,service provider
having the (technical) means and the responsibility to define Usage Contracts and Usage Policies and to provide access to data; and,service provider
Usually a participant acting as Data Owner automatically assumes the role of the Data Provider as well. However there may be cases in which the Data Provider is not the Data Owner (e.g. if the data is technically managed by a different entity than the Data Owner such as in the case of a company using an external IT service provider for data management or if data,service provider
The Data Provider makes data available for being exchanged between a Data Owner and a Data Consumer. As already mentioned above the Data Provider is in most cases identical with the Data Owner but not necessarily. To submit metadata to a Broker or exchange data with a Data Consumer the Data Provider uses software components that are compliant with the Reference Architecture Model of the International Data Spaces.,service provider
Exchanging data with a Data Consumer needs not necessarily be the only activity of the Data Provider. At the end of a data exchange transaction completely or partially executed for example the Data Provider may log the details of the successful (or unsuccessful) completion of the transaction at a Clearing House (see below) to facilitate billing or resolve a conflict. Furthermore the Data Provider can use Data Apps to enrich or transform the data in some way or to improve its quality. (Data Apps are specific applications that can be integrated into the data exchange workflow between two or more participants in the International Data Spaces.),service provider
The management of usage policies becomes especially important when data is to be exchanged across system boundaries. Every time data crosses system boundaries the target system must be prepared for the protection of incoming data (i.e. it has to deploy the corresponding policy).,usge control
In order to implement and enforce usage policies at a specification level within individual target environments it is necessary to map organizational and technical measures to the individual target environments. While organizational measures are out of scope here technical measures involve a variety of additional information sources (PIPs) and tight integration with the host environment (PEPs).,usge control
This way the Information Model provides a technology-agnostic consistent representation of usage control policies across the International Data Spaces.,usge control
The Policy determines the conditions for using the Resource including Pricing in a formal way supporting contract negotiation and (automated) contract enforcement.,usge control
Alongside with data access control regulating access to specific digital resources (e.g. a service or a file) the IDS Security Architecture also supports data usage control. In general the overall goal is to enforce data usage restrictions on the Data Consumer side after access to data has been granted.,usge control
Usage control is an extension of access control (see figure 4.11). It is about the specification and enforcement of restrictions regulating what may be done with a data asset and what not. Thus usage control is concerned with requirements that pertain to data processing (obligations) rather than data access (provisions). Usage control is relevant in the context of intellectual property protection regulatory compliance and digital rights management.,usge control
Data usage control in the IDS basically works by attaching data usage policy information to data being exchanged and continuously controlling the way data is processed aggregated or forwarded to other endpoints. This data-centric perspective allows Data Providers to continuously control data flows rather than accesses to services. At configuration time data usage policies support developers and administrators in setting up correct data flows.,usge control
At runtime data usage control enforcement prevents IDS Connectors from handling data in an undesired way (for example by forwarding personal data to public endpoints). Thus data usage control is both a tool for system integrators to ensure they are not building an architecture that violates security requirements and an audit mechanism providing evidence of compliant data usage.,usge control
It is important to note that the purpose of data usage control is to allow the specification of such constraints and enforcing them in the respective system.,usge control
Extending the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)46 a W3C standard the Information Model’s Usage Control module provides machine-readable specifications of usage control policies,usge control
the PEPs used for usage control (detective enforcement) can also serve as a basis for data provenance tracking whereas in turn data provenance information can be fed back into usage control enforcement (i.e. a usage control PDP can query for all locations of representations of some given data content protected by a usage control policy).,usge control
Set of rules specified by the Data Owner restricting usage of its data; covers aspects like time-to-live or forwarding conditions (e.g. anonymization or scope of usage); transmitted along with the respective data and enforced while residing on the Connector of the Data Consumer,usge control
Usage Policies originally published alongside with a Resource (Contract Offer) are the starting point of a Contract negotiation process. Over the course of this process any incomplete or newly agreed details regarding Resource exchange are complemented such as the identification of the Resource content in question communication Endpoints authorization token(s) or the provisioning period.,usge control
The concept of data usage control allows Data Providers to attach data usage policy information to their data in order to define how a Data Consumer may use the data.,usge control
A precondition of data usage control is that the enforcement mechanism itself is trusted; i.e. data usage control itself does not establish trust in an endpoint but rather builds upon an existing trust relationship and facilitates enforcement of legal or technical requirements such,usge control
The Governance Perspective of the Reference Architecture Model defines the roles functions and processes of the International Data Spaces from a governance and compliance point of view. It thereby defines the requirements to be met by the business ecosystem to achieve secure and reliable corporate interoperability.,usge control
Yet the vision of IDS is right and the implementation requires a legal framework that includes and supports the implementation of technical usage control. With that usage control will have a stronger effect than the traditional licensing models.,usge control
